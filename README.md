# Ice_formation

This repository with the Jupyter notebooks used to plot and pre-process the output data of the models described at:

-   [Idealized Nemo Configuration](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10205736 "NEMO configuration of eddy-sea ice interactions during the freezing season.").
-   [Realistic Nemo Configuration](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7656924 "NEMO configuration of 1/60Â° pan-Arctic simulation.").

The repository also includes the accepted version of the manuscript titled "Eddy-driven heterogeneity in sea ice during the ice-growth season".

The folder structure is as follows: 

- Figures: Notebooks to reproduce all the figures of the manuscript. 
- Processing: Notebooks to preprocess the data used in the manuscript. 
- Manuscript: LaTeX files to recreate the manuscript
